# Results

Since there is 2 tasks to get points:

- 30 - S3 bucket has been created and configured properly. The app has been uploaded to the bucket and is available though the Internet. Nothing else has been done.
- 40 - In addition to the previous work a CloudFront distribution is created and configured properly and the site is served now with CloudFront and is available through the Internet over CloudFront URL, not S3-website link (due to changes in bucketâ€™s policy...).

# Disclaimer

**I decided to not to destroy S3 bucket, since I have to get points for it. Also I have to ensure, that the app is available through the Internet.**
